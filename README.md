# Towards Intlligent Remote Building Management System
## The goal of this project is to make an Artifficialy Intelligent Building Management System that monitors and manages parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Presuure, Power Consumption of Devices and Controls Actuators, Lighting etc through Mobile Application/Website, using IoT Technology and Machine Learning.
As this project is huge, we are currently focusing on implementing a Water Management System, that provides real-time monitoring of Flow Rate, Pump Power Consumption, and Water Level. Along with this, we are also working on basic building management like Monitoring Humidity, and Temperature of a room and Automating Controlling Lights and Fans/Air Conditioning. 
- Motivation: The purpose of technology is to make our lives comfortable. It is important to decrease waste of energy and resources as well as operation cost without compromising the user’s comfort. Hence, our aim is to create a system that focuses on comfort, usability, security and management. The popularity of Internet of Things and emergence of omnipresent sensors will make decision-making process easier by enabling the integration of networks for real time and fast data collection. The biggest motivation for us is that this project will pave a path for further research in the area of intelligent building management. There is also a big demand for such systems in our society at the moment because the wonders of automation have been proved with noticeable decrease in operating cost and an increase in productivity. Hence, it is undeniable that any product that will provide comfort as well as energy management solutions that are reliable and user-friendly will be highly appreciated in the market. 
- Problem Statement: “Implement a Building Management System that monitors the fluid level using ultrasonic and flow rate sensors. Also monitor the humidity and temperature of the building, and power ratings of the devices. Implement the whole system through the Internet of Things technology and create an easy-to-use graphical user interface.”
