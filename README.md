# Towards Intlligent Remote Building Management System
The goal of this project is to make an Artifficialy Intelligent Building Management System that monitors and manages parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Presuure, Power Consumption of Devices and Controls Actuators, Lighting etc through Mobile Application/Website, using IoT Technology and Machine Learning.
As this project is huge, we are currently focusing on implementing a Water Management System, that provides real-time monitoring of Flow Rate, Pump Power Consumption, and Water Level. Along with this, we are also working on basic building management like Monitoring Humidity, and Temperature of a room and Automating Controlling Lights and Fans/Air Conditioning.
